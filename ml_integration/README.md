# Machine Learning Integration (Future Enhancements)

This project explores the potential of integrating Machine Learning (ML) to personalize user experience and improve platform functionality. Here are some planned features for future development:

- **Recommendation Systems:** Leverage ML to recommend products to users based on their browsing history and purchase behavior.
- **Personalized Search & Navigation:** Personalize search results and filter options based on user data and preferences.
- **Personalized Marketing & Promotions:** Segment customer base using ML and send targeted promotions based on user data.

These features are planned for future development and will require additional libraries and functionalities using Python. They will provide an opportunity to learn and practice essential ML concepts in a practical web development context.
